# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue            |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information           |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | AFK — fully specified, ready for the loop          |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | HITL — requires human implementation or sign-off   |
| —                          | `ready-for-review`   | Loop finished the slice; awaiting human review     |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                               |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## AFK vs HITL (the loop boundary)

These two labels are the boundary the agent loop reads (ADR-0045). The distinction is about *what the work needs*, not how hard it is:

- **AFK (`ready-for-agent`)** — *all* acceptance criteria are machine-verifiable **and** the work carries no action a human must authorise. The loop can take it end to end.
- **HITL (`ready-for-human`)** — completing it *in full* needs human sign-off: **either** a criterion no automated check can express, **or** an irreversible/risky action (a DB migration, a destructive change) a human must authorise — *even when that action is itself testable*. The loop sees HITL issues (for dependency context) but never works them.

> This corrects the older "testability is the AFK/HITL boundary" (ADR-0040 §5), which was too narrow: a migration slice is testable yet still HITL.

## The loop's state machine (ADR-0045)

Labels — not commit content — are how the loop tracks doneness:

```
ready-for-agent  ──loop completes slice──▶  ready-for-review  ──human merges PR──▶  (closed)
       ▲                                          │
       └──────────── human rejects ───────────────┘   (+ a `## Rework — why` note on the issue)
```

- The loop **selects** only `ready-for-agent`; it skips `ready-for-review` and `ready-for-human`.
- A `## Blocked by` ref is **satisfied** when that issue is *closed* OR labelled `ready-for-review` — never "has a `Closes` commit" (a rejected slice's `Closes` commit persists and would lie).
- A human who finishes a **HITL** issue must **close it or label it `ready-for-review`**, or its dependants stay wrongly blocked.
